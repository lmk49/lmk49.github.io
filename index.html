Hello! My name is Lyla Kramer and I am 19 years old. I moved from Ohio down to Florida in 2018 to attend college at Florida Gulf Coast University. During my highschool career I was able to graduate with an Honors Diploma and as a Magna Cum Laude. My academic performance during high school allowed me to receive the Blue and Green Director's Award to help aid me in pursuing my studies at FGCU. I am currently in my first year at FGCU and plan to get my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering. My goal is to be able to work on with video games after I graduate since they are something I am very passionate about. 
This website is my portfolio, check around for more information about me!
