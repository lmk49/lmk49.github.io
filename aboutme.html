  <h1 class="h1"> About Me </h1>
    <p class="text"> My name is Lyla Kramer and I moved from Cleveland, Ohio down to Fort Myers, Florida to attend FGCU. I am currently a Freshman in Software Engineering and plan to go on to work on making video games with my degree. After my dad introduced me to them when I was little, I’ve been in love with them ever since. Not many of my friends in real life were as passionate about it as I am, but I’ve been able to make connections with people all over the world thanks to such great online communities. In addition to video games, I have loved writing and reading all throughout my life. I worked as the Editor in Chief for the Eagles Nest Newspaper for two years where we wrote, edited, and published the school’s newspaper. This class was entirely self-funded and is one of the most memorable experiences I have from high school. Our class worked to produce about four newspapers a school year, each one about eight to twelve pages in length. One amazing work that the class was that we were able to work on a history walk in the park in the city. This told the history of how the town was founded as well as the artifacts and other information about the daily life back in the 1800s. 
Additionally, I love to travel. I was originally born in China and I moved to the U.S. when I was only a year old. My parents have also traveled all throughout their lives and have allowed me to have such great possibilities in being able to see the country as well other countries like Canada and Mexico.
